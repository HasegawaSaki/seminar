        **Well, we dream for at least several different reasons.**  
        さて、私たちは少なくともいくつかの異なる理由で夢を見ています。

        **One key benefit is creativity.**  
        主な利点の一つは創造性です。

        **Sleep, including dream sleep, is associated with an enhanced ability to solve next-day problems.**  
        夢を見る睡眠を含む睡眠は、翌日の問題解決能力の向上と関連しています。

        **It's almost as though we go to sleep with the pieces of the jigsaw, but we wake up with the puzzle complete.**  
        まるで私たちがジグソーパズルのピースを持って眠り、目覚めたときにはパズル全体が完成しているかのようです。

        **The second benefit of REM-sleep dreaming is emotional first aid.**  
        REM睡眠中の夢のもう一つの利点は感情的な応急処置です。

        **REM sleep takes the painful sting out of difficult emotional experiences so that when we come back the next day, we feel better about those painful events.**  
        REM睡眠はつらい感情的経験の痛みを和らげるため、翌日それらの出来事について前よりも気分が良くなるのです。

        **You can almost think of dreaming as a form of overnight therapy.**  
        夢を見ることは、一晩で行われるセラピーのようなものだと考えられるでしょう。

        **It's not time that heals all wounds, but it's time during dream sleep that provides emotional convalescence.**  
        すべての傷を癒すのは単なる時間ではなく、夢の中で眠っているその時間こそが感情の回復をもたらすのです。

        **Now, it's not just that you dream. It's also what you dream about that seems to make a difference.**  
        さて、夢を見ること自体だけでなく、「何について夢を見るか」も違いを生んでいるようです。

        **Scientists have discovered that after learning a virtual maze, for example, those individuals who slept but critically also dreamed about the maze were the only ones who ended up being better at navigating the maze when they woke up.**  
        例えば、仮想迷路の操作を学んだ後で、眠った人の中でも特にその迷路について夢を見た人だけが、目覚めたときにより上手に迷路を進めることができると科学者たちは発見しました。

        **And this same principle is true for our mental health.**  
        そして、この同じ原則は私たちの心の健康にも当てはまります。

        **For example, people going through a difficult or traumatic experience such as a divorce, and who are dreaming about that event, go on to gain resolution to their depression relative to those who were dreaming but not dreaming about the events themselves.**  
        例えば、離婚のような困難やトラウマとなる経験をしている人で、その出来事について夢を見る人は、そうでない夢を見る人と比べ、うつ状態の解消に至ることがより多いのです。

        **All of which means that sleep and the very act of dreaming itself appears to be an essential ingredient to so much of our waking lives.**  
        これら全ては、睡眠および夢を見るという行為そのものが、私たちの起きている時間の生活にとって不可欠な要素であることを意味しています。

        **We dream, therefore we are.**  
        私たちは夢を見る。ゆえに私たちは存在する。

This is the TED Talk script we are university students. (CFER level is B2) we are going to conversation with class mate so please create conversation of this situation


I think the conversation is so good like below

Maria:Hey Liam, what did you think of the TED Talk about dreaming?
Liam: I thought it was really interesting. I didn’t know that dreaming could help us solve problems. That part about the jigsaw puzzle really made sense.
Maria: Yeah, I liked that example too. It’s like your brain keeps working while you sleep. Do you ever get creative ideas after you wake up?
Liam: Actually, yes! Sometimes I wake up with a new idea for my project. Maybe that’s dream creativity in action!
Maria: Could be! I also found it surprising that REM sleep helps with emotions. Like, how dreaming works like therapy.
Liam: Right! He said it's not just time that heals, but dream time. That was a powerful point. So dreaming helps us feel better after emotional experiences?
Maria: Exactly. I think that’s why we feel a little better after a hard day—dreaming helps process those feelings.
Liam: Did you hear the part about people dreaming about a maze? The ones who dreamed about it actually improved their skills.
Maria: Yes! That was amazing. So maybe if we dream about exams, we’ll do better? [laughs]
Liam: Haha, I wish! But seriously, it shows that what we dream about is important—not just the fact that we dream.
Maria: True. He also mentioned people dreaming about trauma, like divorce, and how that helped them recover from depression.
Liam: That shows how connected dreaming is to mental health. I never thought dreams had such a strong effect on our real life.
Maria: Me neither. It makes me want to learn more about REM sleep. Do you remember the final line? “We dream, therefore we are.”
Liam: Yeah, that was deep. It’s like dreaming is a key part of being human.
Maria: I agree. Anyway, I’ll try to get more sleep tonight. Maybe I’ll solve all my problems in a dream!
Liam: Good idea! Sweet dreams, Maria!
Maria: You too, Liam!

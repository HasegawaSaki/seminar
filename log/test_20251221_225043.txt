GPT: Please summarize the content of this video?
User: She mistakenly used the word pregnant for embarrassed. [0分2秒]1
GPT: Yeah, exactly! She thought "embarazada" meant "embarrassed" in Spanish, but it actually means "pregnant." 😂 Because of this mistake, everyone thought she was announcing her pregnancy instead of saying she was embarrassed. Do you want to add anything else?

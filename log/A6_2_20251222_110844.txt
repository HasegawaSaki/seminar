> - **❌ has a confidence**
>   **✅ was confident**
>   「自信がある」と言いたい場合、"has a confidence" より "was confident" とするのが自然です。
> 
> - **❌ moved to Spanish**
>   **✅ moved to Mexico**
>   ここで「スペイン語」という言語を国のように使っていますが、動画では彼女は「メキシコ」に引っ越したと言っています。
> 
> - **❌ misunderstood the meaning of words**
>   **✅ misunderstood the meaning of a word**
>   「言葉」を指す場合は "the meaning of a word" や、具体的に "one word" と単数形にするほうが意味が明確になります。

> She confused "embarrassed," because "embarrassed" in English means shy, but in Spanish, it means pregnant.
> 
> - **❌ because "embarrassed"in English means shy, but one in Spanish means pregnant.**
>   **✅ because "embarrassed" in English means shy, but in Spanish, it means pregnant.**
>   "one" は不適切なので "but in Spanish, it means pregnant" としてください。  
> 
> - **❌ "embarrassed"in**
>   **✅ "embarrassed" in**
>   単語と "in" の間にスペースを入れましょう。
> 
> - **❌ but one in Spanish**
>   **✅ but in Spanish**
>   ここで "one" という代名詞は必要ありません。"but in Spanish" だけで十分です。
> 
> - **❌ means shy**
>   **✅ means embarrassed (or ashamed)**
>   "embarrassed" は基本的に「恥ずかしい」や「困惑した」というニュアンスで、"shy"（内気な）とは少し違います。ここでは "means embarrassed" や "means ashamed" のほうが適切です。

>
> - **❌ misunderstood she was a pregnant**
>   **✅ misunderstood that she was pregnant**
>   "misunderstood" の後は必ず "that S + V" で内容を説明するのが正しいです。また "a pregnant"は不自然なので"a"は不要です。
> 
> - **❌ a pregnant**
>   **✅ pregnant**
>   "pregnant"は形容詞なので"a"を付けません。

> The speaker moved to Mexico. She knew a few Spanish words, and she thought that she had matured, so she was confident. However, she misunderstood a word.

-   **❌ She knew a little Mexican words**
    **✅ She knew a few Spanish words**
    "Mexican" は言語名ではなく、「Spanish」が正解です。さらに、「a little」は不可算名詞に使うので、「a few」が正しい表現です。

-   **❌ she thought that she matured**
    **✅ she thought that she had matured**
    「matured」は過去完了形の方が自然です。行為が過去に完了していることを強調したい場合に使います。

-   **❌ so she had a confident**
    **✅ so she was confident**
    「confident」は形容詞なので、「be動詞+confident」が正しいです。「a confident」という名詞形は使いません。

-   **❌ she took misunderstanding**
    **✅ she misunderstood a word**
    「take misunderstanding」は不自然な表現です。シンプルに「misunderstood a word（単語を誤解した）」が正しいです。

GPT: Great effort! You're getting closer. You mentioned that she misunderstood a word—do you remember which word it was and what the misunderstanding caused? Try adding what happened because of the mistake.

- **❌ she thought that she had matured ,**
  **✅ she thought that she had matured,**
  カンマの前にスペースは不要です。正しい位置(単語直後)にしましょう。

- **❌ she misunderstood  word.**
  **✅ she misunderstood a word.**
  「a」を忘れずに入れてください。特定の語の「一つ」を指したい場合は「a」が必要です。

- **❌ This is a emmbarrasing episord of her.**
  **✅ This was an embarrassing episode for her.**
  「emmbarrasing」「episord」はそれぞれ「embarrassing」「episode」が正しいスペルです。  
  「This was an embarrassing episode for her.」が自然な表現です。「of her」だと不自然になります。

添削後の文  
> The speaker moved to Mexico. She knew a few Spanish words, and she thought that she had matured, so she was confident. However, she misunderstood a word. When she went to a mall, a man on a stage spoke to her. She misunderstood the word "embarazada," thinking it meant "embarrassed," but it actually means "pregnant." This was an embarrassing episode for her.

- **❌ she was talked from a man on a stage.**
  **✅ a man on a stage spoke to her.**
  「was talked from」は不自然で、「spoke to her」が自然な表現です。

- **❌ She misunderstood a word like "embarrasing".**
  **✅ She misunderstood the word "embarazada," thinking it meant "embarrassed."**
  「like 'embarrassing'」は意味が曖昧なので、実際に混同した単語（"embarazada" と "embarrassed"）を明確に書きましょう。

- **❌ But, this real meaning is pregnate.**
  **✅ But it actually means "pregnant."**
  「pregnate」はスペルミスで、正しくは「pregnant」です。「But, this real meaning is」は不自然な表現なので、「But it actually means "pregnant."」が自然です。

- **構成の工夫**
  「She was talked from...」の部分以降、時系列を整理して「彼女がどんなシチュエーションで誤解し、どうなったか」を明確にすると、さらに良い流れになります。

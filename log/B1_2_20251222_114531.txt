User: The speaker made mistake of meaning that is embarrassed and the the man thought she preignant  in girl3
GPT: Yeah, that’s basically it! She tried to say she was embarrassed in Spanish but accidentally said she was pregnant, so the man at the mall congratulated her instead. 😆 In my opinion, it’s a funny example of how language mistakes can lead to confusing situations! 

Could you try to put that summary in your own words in English?
User: Yes. The speaker wanted to say to be embarrased but she does not know meaning  in Spanish [1分29秒]4
GPT: Nice! And because she used the wrong word, the man thought she was saying she was pregnant, not embarrassed. 😅

GPT: Please summarize the content of this video?
User: She had confident for her language skill of Spanish but she had mistake for conversation with a boy and she felt bad.  [3分5秒]1
GPT: Yeah, I think so too! In my opinion, she thought she knew Spanish well, but she made a funny mistake and accidentally told everyone she was pregnant instead of saying she was embarrassed. 😅 What do you think, should we mention how everyone congratulated her?
User: It's better to add that I was embarrassed because everyone was celebrating. [1分41秒]2
GPT: Great idea! So maybe we can say: She tried to say she was embarrassed, but accidentally said she was pregnant in Spanish, and everyone started congratulating her, which made her feel even more embarrassed. 😆 Does this sound good to you?

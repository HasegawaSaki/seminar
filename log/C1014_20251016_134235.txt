GPT: What did you think of the TED Talk?
User: I learned about the sleeping can help healing when people sting. [0分52秒]
GPT: ### Sentence correction
- **the sleeping can help healing when people sting → sleeping can help with healing when people are hurt.**
「the sleeping」は具体的な睡眠というよりも一般的な睡眠を指すので「sleeping」が適切です。「sting」は「刺す」ことに関連していますが、この文脈では「hurt」や「in pain」が正しいでしょう。

Correct version: I learned that sleeping can help with healing when people are hurt.

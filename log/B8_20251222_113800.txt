> - **❌ Sapnish**
>   **✅ Spanish**
>   スペルミスです。正しくは "Spanish" です。
>
> - **❌ At first, she was confident to use Spanish.**
>   **✅ At first, she was confident using Spanish.**
>   "confident to use" よりも "confident using" の方が自然な表現です。
>
> - **❌ an even**
>   **✅ an event**
>   "even" は「〜ですら」の意味なので、"event"（イベント）が正しいです。
>
> - **❌ Sapnish man**
>   **✅ Spanish man**
>   スペルミスです。
>
> - **❌ did use wrong word to him**
>   **✅ used the wrong word**
>   "did use wrong word" は不自然なので、"used the wrong word" のようにシンプルにしましょう。
>
> - **❌ "I'm pregnaunt."**
>   **✅ "I'm pregnant."**
>   スペルミスです。"pregnant"が正しいです。
>
> - **❌ she did use wrong word**
>   **✅ she used the wrong word**
>   助動詞 "did" はここでは不要なので、普通に過去形を使いましょう。

>
> - **❌ The man reacted like really happy and surprised.**
>   **✅ The man reacted by looking really happy and surprised.**
>   "reacted like" は不自然です。"by looking" や "was" を使うと自然になります。
>
> - **❌ even thougt**
>   **✅ even though**
>   スペルミスです。正しくは "though" です。
>
> - **❌ had a confidence using Spanish**
>   **✅ was confident using Spanish**
>   "have confidence" の場合は "in" を使い、"confident" は形容詞なので "was confident" が正しいです。
>
> - **❌ it may be able to make a mistake from this experience**
>   **✅ she could still make mistakes from this experience**
>   主語が "she" であるため、"she could still make mistakes" と書くと自然です。また、"may be able to" はここでは不要です。

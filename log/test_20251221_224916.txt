GPT: Please summarize the content of this video?
User: She mistakenly used the word pregnant for embarrassed. [0分4秒]1
GPT: Yeah, that’s right! She tried to say she was embarrassed in Spanish, but used “embarazada,” which actually means pregnant, so people thought she was announcing a pregnancy. 😅 Do you want to add anything else to the summary?

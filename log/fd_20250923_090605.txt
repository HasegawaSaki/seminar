GPT: ### Sentence correction
- **carshering. → carpooling.**
  "Carshering" is not a commonly used term. The correct term in this context is "carpooling," which refers to sharing a vehicle for transportation. 

- **leads that driver get → allows drivers to earn**
  The phrase "leads that driver get" is unnatural in this context. "Allows drivers to earn" clearly expresses the idea that carpooling provides a financial benefit to drivers.
  
Correct version of the sentence:
“I thought that the idea of carpooling is so groundbreaking. It allows drivers to earn more money.”

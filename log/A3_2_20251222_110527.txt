> This is Todd. He works in Japan and he talks about his favorite beach in Beppu. He likes this beach near his house for some reasons. He says the place is quiet because there aren't many people. In addition, he can see many planes from the airport in that area. He can also walk, relax, and listen to the waves.

- **❌ This is Todd.**  
  **✅ Hi, this is Todd. / In this video, Todd talks about...**  
  普通、自己紹介からビデオの内容を述べる時は "This is Todd" も使えますが、より文脈に合わせると "In this video, Todd..." の方が自然です。

- **❌ cause some reasons**  
  **✅ for some reasons**  
  "cause" はカジュアルすぎて不自然です。"for some reasons" が正解です。

- **❌ feel relax**  
  **✅ relax**  
  "feel relax" ではなく、"relax"（動詞）でOKです。"He can relax" と言いましょう。

- **❌ listen to the waves.**  
  文法的な誤りはありませんが、前に "and" を入れたほうが列挙で自然です。

- **❌ from airport**  
  **✅ from the airport**  
  定冠詞 "the" を忘れずに。

- **❌ walk, feel relax and listen...**  
  **✅ walk, relax, and listen...**  
  "feel relax" は間違い。普通は "relax" と動詞で言います。また、"and" の前にコンマを入れる（オックスフォードコンマ）とより正確です。

全体的に伝わりますが、文をもう少し短くまとめ、要点だけ残すとより良い要約になります！
User: Thank you. What is the main feature? I do not have idea. [0分57秒]2
GPT: No problem! The main feature Todd talks about is that the beach is peaceful and quiet, which he really enjoys. He also likes that it’s clean and close to a beautiful forest. Can you try to write a short summary using these main features?

> - **❌ I do not have idea.**

> 文法的には正しいですが、より自然に聞くなら "What is the main feature of the beach?" や "What is the main thing he likes about the beach?" も使えます。

> **✅ Could you tell me your answer? / What would your summary be?**

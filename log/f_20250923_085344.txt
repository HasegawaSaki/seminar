GPT: ### Sentence correction
- **learnd → learned**  
'learned' は正しい過去形のスペルです。
- **it is times during dreaming → it is time during dream sleep**  
'it is time during dream sleep' のように、特に 'REM-sleep' を指す場合は 'time during dream sleep' が正確です。
- **recover us → helps us recover**  
'recover'を他動詞として使う場合、通常対象を必要とし、ここでは 'helps us recover' のように「〜を回復させる」と正しく表現する必要があります。

Correct version: I learned that it is not time that heals wounds, but it is time during dream sleep that heals wounds and helps us recover.

### Chat about the video
The TED Talk emphasizes that it's specifically during REM-sleep dreaming that our bodies process and alleviate emotional pain. This dream sleep acts as a sort of emotional first aid, helping us to feel better about painful events. It's an important reminder that quality sleep and dreaming have a significant impact on our emotional well-being.

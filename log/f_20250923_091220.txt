GPT: what did you think of the TED Talk about?
User: I learnd that it is not time that heals wounds , but it is times during dreaming that heals wounds and recover us [0分4秒]
GPT: ### Sentence correction
- **learnd → learned** 
"Learnd"は誤ったスペルで、正しくは「学んだ」という意味の"learned"です。
- **times during dreaming → time during dreaming** 
「夢の間の時間」という場合、単数形の"time"が文脈に合います。
- **recover us → helps us recover** 
'recover'を他動詞として使う場合、通常対象を必要とし、ここでは 'helps us recover' のように「～を回復させる」と正しく表現する必要があります。

Correct version: I learned that it is not time that heals wounds, but it is time during dreaming that heals wounds and helps us recover.

### Chat about the video
The TED Talk highlights the unique role of dreaming in emotional healing. It explains that REM-sleep dreaming aids in processing and alleviating the emotional intensity of painful experiences. It's this dream time, not just time itself, that facilitates emotional recovery and problem-solving abilities.

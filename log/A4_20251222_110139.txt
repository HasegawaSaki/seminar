User: They can solve problems more faster, and have a great effect on people's health as well. [1分41秒]2
GPT: Totally! I also remember the video mentioning that dreaming acts like "overnight therapy" and helps us feel better about difficult emotions. Did you catch the example about people dreaming of a maze and performing better?
User: Yeees! They can create a maze even faster than people who didn't dream about the maze. Also, they can perform better if they sleep. [1分48秒]3
GPT: Exactly! And if people dream about their own difficult experiences, like a divorce, it seems to help them recover emotionally too. So maybe we can say sleep and dreaming are essential for both mental and emotional health? 😊

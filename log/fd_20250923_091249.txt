GPT: ### Sentence correction
- **carshering → car sharing**
  スペースを入れて 'car sharing' にしてください。
- **leads that driver → allows the driver**
  'leads that driver' は不自然なので、'allows the driver'（運転手が～できるようになる）と表現してください。
- **get more money → to earn more money**
  文脈に沿って 'get' の代わりに 'to earn' を使ってください。

Correct version: 
"I thought that the idea of car sharing is so groundbreaking. It allows the driver to earn more money."

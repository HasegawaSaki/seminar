### Language Feedback and Correction

- **❌ She was bought both**
  **✅ She bought both**

  The passive form 'was bought' implies someone else bought the food for Anna, whereas you want to express that Anna herself bought the food. Hence, 'She bought both' is correct. 

**文章全体の訂正バージョン:**
Anna decided to buy both healthy and junk food to balance their need.

GPT: Please summarize the content of this video?
User: The woman felts confident that she was doing well when she moved to Mexico because she was mature enough. When she was in shopping mall, she saw a man. He told her that he wanted her to play on the stage. She felt embarrassed about playing on the stage and she tried to say that in Spanish. However, although she said "embarrassed" in Spanish, he didn't understand what she meant. That was because what she said in Spanish didn't actually mean "embarrassed" but "pregnant". That is, she failed to tell him her feeling, so he misunderstood. [11分53秒]1
GPT: That's a good summary that captures the main story and misunderstanding! Can you make it even shorter and focus on the most important details in just 2-3 sentences?

> 
> - **❌ felts**
>   **✅ felt**
>   'Felts' は正しい活用ではなく、過去形は 'felt' です。
> 
> - **❌ she was doing well**
>   **✅ she was confident**
>   'Doing well' はここではやや抽象的なので、シンプルに 'confident'（自信を持っていた）が適切です。
> 
> - **❌ she saw a man. He told her...**
>   **✅ a man invited her...**
>   2文に分ける必要はなく、"A man invited her" のように簡潔にまとめられます。
> 
> - **❌ she tried to say that in Spanish. However, although she said "embarrassed" in Spanish, he didn't understand ...**
>   **✅ she tried to say she was embarrassed in Spanish, but...**
>   繰り返しの表現なので、1つの文にまとめると自然です。
> 
> - **❌ That is, she failed to tell him her feeling, so he misunderstood.**
>   **✅ She accidentally said "pregnant," so he misunderstood her.**
>   より明確に状況を表現できます。「そのため」や「つまり」の直接的な表現は不要です。

> - **❌ in shopping mall**
>   **✅ at a shopping mall**
>   'In' ではなく 'at' が正しい前置詞です（場所を特定する場合）。
>
> - **❌ play on the stage**
>   **✅ join a play on stage**
>   'Play on the stage' では「ステージで遊ぶ」になってしまう場合があるので、'join a play on stage'（ステージで演劇に参加する）が自然です。
>
> - **❌ she mistook to say "pregnant"**
>   **✅ she mistakenly said "pregnant"**
>   'Mistook to say' は不自然な表現で、正しくは 'mistakenly said' です（"間違って～と言った"）。
>
> - **❌ which led to misunderstanding.**
>   **✅ which led to a misunderstanding.**
>   'Misunderstanding' は可算名詞なので、冠詞 'a' を付けましょう。
User: why is "at" proper ? [1分37秒]4
User: why is "at" proper ?5
GPT: Great question! “At” is used because it refers to a specific location, such as a building or event, in this case “at a shopping mall.” We use “at” to focus on the point/place as a spot, while “in” is used for something inside an enclosed space.

For example, you say “at the airport,” “at the store,” or “at a concert,” to indicate your presence at those locations.

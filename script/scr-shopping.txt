Anna: Hi there, Ashley!
Ashley: Anna! Hi! Where are you going?
(Anna’s stomach growls loudly)
Ashley: What was that?
Anna: I’m hungry. When I’m hungry, I only want to eat junk food! But I know I should eat healthy food. So, I fight with myself. One side says, ‘You should eat healthy food.’ The other side says, ‘But I want to eat junk food!’
Ashley: Well, Anna, go to the Giant supermarket. You should be able to find all kinds of food there - for all of you.
Anna: Good idea, Ashley. See you later!
Ashley: 'Bye, Anna.
Anna: Wow! This supermarket is huge! Look at all of these fruits and vegetables! I should eat more vegetables.
Healthy: Good idea, Anna. You must eat more vegetables … like celery!
Junky: Celery?! Do you know what the web says about celery?
Anna: No, what?
Junky: “Celery is 95 percent water - 100 percent NOT ice cream. I love the web!”
Healthy*: Anna, you mustn’t eat junk food. Junk food will kill you.
Junky*: You are being silly.
Healthy: No, you are!
Junky: No, you are.
Anna: Will you two please be nice to each other? It is important to eat healthy foods. But, a little junk food will not kill me. Hmm, ice cream. Ice cream does sound good.
Junky: Take this cart to the frozen food aisle!
Healthy: No wait, go back! Go back! We forgot fruit. Go back!!
Anna: Okay, we are in the frozen food aisle!
Junky: Mmm, ice cream!
Healthy: Mmm, frozen peas!
Junky: Nobody says, ‘Mmm, frozen peas. They say, ‘Mmm, ice cream!
Healthy: Mmm, frozen peas!!
Junky: Mmm, ice cream!!
Anna: I am not going to tell you two again! Stop fighting!
Anna: I smell fresh bread! I love the smells of a bakery!
Healthy: Oh, Anna, let’s buy a fresh loaf of whole wheat, organic bread!
Junky: You don’t have to buy bread. Buy some donuts, Anna!
Healthy: You mustn’t buy donuts. They are only fat and sugar.
Junky: Exactly! You know, you are really no fun at all.
Healthy: And you must think having high cholesterol is fun.
Junky: Everyone likes donuts! That is why you don’t have friends!
Healthy: And that is why your cholesterol is so high!
Junky: My cholesterol is none of your business!!
Healthy: And I have lots of friends!!
Anna: Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! I am sick and tired of the both of you!!
Anna: I know what you two need!
Junky: Anna! What are you doing?
Healthy: Put me down!
Anna: You two need to cool off!
Anna: I am going to go buy my healthy food and my junk food! Good bye!
Anna: Until next time …

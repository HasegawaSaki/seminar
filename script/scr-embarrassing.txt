Hello, my name is Preah, and I am from Belize. My question is, what was your most embarrassing moment? 
So when I was 18 years old, I decided that I wanted to move to Mexico. I was an adult, and I felt like I could do anything I wanted. I also thought that I knew Spanish, but I quickly learned that I didn't know as much as I thought. So I was at this mall and there was this man. He was doing a play, and he wanted to invite me on stage as a part of his play. 
And I kept telling him in Spanish, "Soy embarazado. Soy embarazado."
And I thought that I was saying, "I'm embarrassed" because "embarazado - embarrassed" I thought they meant the same thing. 
And he kept telling me, "congratulations, congratulations." 
And I was like, "no, soy embarazado." 
And he kept saying, "congratulations, boy or girl?" 
And I was like, "I am a girl," I told him. 
It wasn't until afterwards I realized, or I learned that "embarazado" or "embarazada" meant pregnant and embarrassed, what I actually wanted to say, meant "avergonzado," right?
So that was pretty embarrassing because everyone thought that I was pregnant, but I actually wanted to say that I was embarrassed.

Hi everybody, this is Todd, your a teacher from ELLLO. 
And right now I am at my favorite place and this is a beach near my house where I live and teach and work in Japan.
And I love this beach for many reasons. 
One, there aren't many people on the beach, so usually this beach is really quiet and there's not a lot going on.
There's many trees near the beach. 
There's a beautiful forest, so you can kind of take a walk in there. 
And the beach usually is really clean. 
There isn't much pollution, there isn't much noise, although sometimes you can hear a plane because many planes land by the airport. 
I guess we can't see one now, but there are many planes in this area, and it's just a nice place.
There's a lot of space, there's a lot of light,, and it's just a really peaceful place.
And so because of that, I really enjoy it.
And there's many things you can do here.
You can take a walk, you can relax on the beach, you can listen to the waves.
It's just really, really peaceful.
So for that reason, I love this beach.
It's my favorite place in Beppu.
